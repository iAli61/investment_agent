7. Detailed Requirements

7.1 Core Application Requirements

Requirement IDDescriptionUser StoryExpected Behavior/OutcomeFR-001Property Data InputAs a property investor, I want to enter basic property details so that I can analyze its investment potential.The system should provide input fields for property address, purchase price, property type, year built, size in square meters, number of units, and condition assessment. Data validation ensures numbers are within reasonable ranges. Fields can be auto-populated by AI agents (e.g., Description Analysis Agent).FR-002Purchase Cost CalculatorAs an investor, I want to calculate total acquisition costs including closing fees so I understand the full initial investment.When a user enters the purchase price, the system automatically calculates estimated closing costs (notary, tax, agent fees) based on regional standards (potentially informed by Tax/Regulation Agent). User can override with actual figures. Total acquisition cost updates automatically.FR-003Financing DetailsAs an investor, I want to input my financing structure so I can understand my loan requirements.User can enter available cash, desired down payment, and receive calculations for loan amount needed. System should validate that down payment meets minimum requirements. Can be enhanced by Mortgage Rate Agent findings.FR-004Mortgage Payment CalculatorAs an investor, I want to calculate my monthly mortgage payments based on various financing terms.System calculates monthly payments using input loan amount, interest rate, repayment rate (Tilgung), and term. Calculations should show amortization schedule. Can compare against current rates from Mortgage Rate Agent.FR-005Multi-Unit Rental StructureAs an investor buying a multi-unit building, I want to input details for each unit independently.System allows adding information for multiple units (occupied/vacant status, size, current rent, potential rent, lease terms). Each unit should be stored separately. Rent fields can be populated by Rent Estimation Agent.FR-006Rental Income ProjectionsAs an investor, I want to estimate potential rental income for vacant units based on local market data.System calculates potential rent based on unit size, features, and location using either manual input or suggestions from the Rent Estimation Agent, which cites sources and checks regulations (Mietpreisbremse).FR-007Operating Expenses CalculationAs an investor, I want to estimate all recurring expenses to determine net operating income.System calculates all regular expenses including property tax (informed by Tax Agent), insurance, non-recoverable maintenance costs (potentially informed by Doc Analysis), property management, and a reserve fund. Expenses calculated as fixed amounts and percentages.FR-008Tax Benefit CalculatorAs an investor, I want to estimate my tax benefits from property depreciation and expenses.System calculates depreciation (AfA) based on building value and current rules (verified by Tax Agent), mortgage interest deductions, and other qualifying expenses. Tax benefit calculated using user's marginal tax rate.FR-009Cash Flow AnalysisAs an investor, I want to see detailed monthly and annual cash flow projections.System generates comprehensive cash flow statement showing all income sources (actual + estimated) and expenses, with monthly/annual views. Cash flow before/after tax benefits clearly displayed.FR-010Personal Affordability AssessmentAs an investor, I want to evaluate if I can personally afford this investment given my other financial obligations.User can input personal income, existing debt, and living expenses. System compares total income to total expenses including the new investment to provide affordability assessment.7.2 AI Agent RequirementsRequirement IDDescriptionUser StoryExpected Behavior/OutcomeAI-001Market Data Search AgentRefined: Autonomously gathers, verifies, and stores relevant market data from diverse online sources for specific locations and property types. Acts as a specialized tool/plugin."As an investment analyst, I want the system to automatically find the latest average rental prices per square meter for 3-bedroom apartments in 'Düsseldorf-Pempelfort', vacancy rates for the last quarter, and recent comparable property sales, so that I have accurate, localized data for my financial models."AI-002Rent Estimation AgentRefined: Uses LLM, market data (from AI-001), and property details to generate reasoned rental income estimates, explaining reasoning and checking regulations."As an investor evaluating a vacant 75sqm apartment with a balcony in 'Berlin-Mitte', I want the Rent Estimation Agent to analyze its features against current market data, provide a realistic monthly Nettokaltmiete (NKM) range, explain why (citing comparables), and check compliance with the Mietpreisbremse."AI-003Tax Regulation Monitoring AgentRefined: Continuously monitors specified official sources for relevant tax law changes (e.g., AfA rules). Updates a knowledge base (VectorDB) and can trigger notifications/recalculations."As a portfolio manager, I want the Tax Regulation Agent to monitor the German Federal Ministry of Finance website for changes to depreciation schedules (AfA) or deductibility rules, so my application's tax calculations remain compliant and I'm alerted to impactful changes."AI-004Property Description Analysis AgentRefined: Utilizes LLM to parse unstructured text (listings, descriptions) to extract key property attributes and populate application fields."As an investor, I want to paste a listing description and have the Agent automatically extract address, size, rooms, year built, price, features ('balcony', 'renovated'), and prompt me for missing critical info like rental status."AI-005Investment Risk Assessment AgentRefined: Synthesizes data from multiple sources (property, market, trends, regulations) using LLM for a qualitative assessment of risks and opportunities."As an advisor, I want the Risk Agent to analyze Property X's profile (financials, condition, location trends from AI-006, financing) and generate a summary of top 3 risks (e.g., 'High vacancy rate', 'Upcoming maintenance', 'Rate sensitivity') and opportunities (e.g., 'Rent increase potential', 'Infrastructure development', 'Below-market price')."AI-006Market Trend Analysis AgentRefined: Analyzes historical/current market data, news feeds, demographic/economic reports to identify and summarize relevant trends for a specific area."As an investor considering a long-term hold in 'Leipzig-Plagwitz', I want the Trend Agent to report on recent (2yr) and projected (3-5yr) trends in population growth, major employers, infrastructure projects, gentrification indicators, citing sources, to evaluate appreciation potential."AI-007Mortgage Rate Monitoring AgentRefined: Periodically checks specified financial sources for current mortgage rates based on user profiles, comparing against existing/proposed financing."As a homeowner with a mortgage renewal in 12 months for Investment Y, I want the Mortgage Agent to track 10yr fixed rates for €300k/80% LTV from major German lenders and alert me if rates drop >0.25% below mine, so I can consider refinancing."AI-008Optimization Recommendation AgentRefined: Analyzes a completed investment profile using LLM (and rules/models) to suggest actionable strategies for improving financial performance."After analyzing Investment Z, I want the Optimization Agent to suggest 3 actions like 'Convert attic (€15k est.) for +€150/mo rent', 'Refinance based on current rates (via AI-007) to save €50/mo', or 'Adjust rents for Units A&B to market (via AI-002) on turnover'."AI-009Document Analysis AgentRefined: Uses LLM (with OCR if needed) to extract specific information from uploaded legal/administrative property documents."During due diligence, I want to upload the Teilungserklärung and HOA minutes for a condo and have the Doc Agent extract Miteigentumsanteil, Sondernutzungsrechte, planned maintenance/levies (Sonderumlagen), and recurring issues, highlighting red flags."AI-010Reporting and Explanation AgentRefined: Generates natural language summaries/explanations of complex analyses and findings, tailoring language/depth to user profile/request."As an advisor presenting to a novice client, I want the Reporting Agent to generate a 1-page executive summary in simple terms, explaining key metrics (CoC Return, Cap Rate), main risks (from AI-005), potential upside (from AI-008), and a final recommendation, avoiding jargon."7.2.1 Agent Communication Flow Example (Property Analysis Task)This diagram illustrates a potential interaction sequence between the orchestrator and various agent plugins for a standard property analysis request, after the initial user request is received by the orchestrator.sequenceDiagram

7.3 Technical Implementation RequirementsRequirement IDDescriptionUser StoryExpected Behavior/OutcomeTI-001Agent Orchestration FrameworkAs a developer, I need a system to coordinate multiple AI agents working on different tasks for a single user request.Python-based orchestration framework (e.g., Semantic Kernel, LangChain) managing agent invocation (as plugins/tools), planning sequences, managing context (session state, history), handling dependencies, aggregating results, and providing unified logging/monitoring. Must handle agent failures gracefully.TI-002Web Scraping InfrastructureAs a system administrator, I need reliable infrastructure for collecting market data from diverse web sources ethically.Python-based scraping framework (e.g., Scrapy, Playwright) with proxy rotation, user-agent management, rate limiting, CAPTCHA handling considerations, and robust error handling. Must respect robots.txt, handle dynamic content, and maintain adaptable scraping patterns for key data sources.TI-003LLM Integration ArchitectureAs a developer, I need flexible integration with multiple LLM providers and models.Abstraction layer allowing easy switching between LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, local models) with standardized interfaces. Implements prompt templating, prompt engineering best practices (e.g., structured output, function calling), context window management, token optimization, and fallback strategies.TI-004Agent Learning System (Feedback Loop)As a user, I want agents to improve based on my feedback and corrections on their outputs.System allows users to rate agent outputs (e.g., rent estimates, risk assessments) and provide corrections/alternative information. This feedback is stored and used for periodic fine-tuning, prompt refinement, or improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge bases.TI-005Data Verification & Confidence SystemAs a user, I want confidence that agent-collected data and analyses are accurate and reliable.Multi-layered verification system: cross-references data from multiple sources, uses validation rules, flags inconsistencies, and assigns/displays confidence scores for agent-provided data and conclusions. Clearly distinguishes facts from estimations/opinions.TI-006Vector Database for RAGAs a developer, I need a vector store to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation for agents needing specific knowledge (e.g., Tax Agent, Doc Agent).Integration with a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB, PGVector) to store embeddings of regulatory documents, property documents, market reports, etc. Agents query this DB to retrieve relevant context before generating responses, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.TI-007A2A Protocol ImplementationAs a developer, I need to implement the server-side logic for handling Agent-to-Agent protocol requests.Backend implements JSON-RPC endpoints for tasks/send, tasks/sendSubscribe, agent/getCard, etc., as defined by the A2A specification. Includes task management (queuing, state tracking), session handling, and mapping internal agent states/outputs to A2A response formats (TaskStatus, Artifacts).7.4 User Interface RequirementsRequirement IDDescriptionUser StoryExpected Behavior/OutcomeUI-001Responsive DesignAs a user, I want to access the application seamlessly from my desktop, tablet, or smartphone.The application UI must be fully responsive, adapting layout, navigation, and element sizes for optimal viewing and interaction across all common device screen sizes and orientations.UI-002Interactive DashboardAs a user, I want an at-a-glance overview of key investment metrics and agent insights upon opening an analysis.Dashboard presents critical metrics (cash flow, ROI, cap rate) visually (charts, gauges). Includes summaries from key agents (e.g., top risks, rent potential). Users can customize layout/visible metrics.UI-003Step-by-Step Input WizardAs a new user, I want clear guidance through the initial data input process for a property.Application offers an optional wizard interface for entering property details, financing, etc., with contextual help, input validation, progress tracking, and explanations for complex terms (tooltips, info icons).UI-004Real-Time Calculation & Agent UpdatesAs a user, I want to see the immediate impact of changing inputs and receive live updates as agents work.Financial calculations update instantly upon input changes. For longer analyses using tasks/sendSubscribe, the UI displays status updates from the orchestrator ("Fetching market data...", "Analyzing risks...") and populates results as they become available.UI-005Comparison ViewAs a user evaluating options, I want to easily compare multiple investment scenarios or properties side-by-side.Application allows saving different scenarios (e.g., varying financing, renovation plans) for a property, or comparing multiple properties. A dedicated comparison view highlights key differences in inputs, calculated metrics, and agent assessments.UI-006Agent Output PresentationAs a user, I want agent-generated information to be clearly presented, sourced, and distinguishable from my own inputs.UI clearly labels data originating from AI agents (e.g., "Est. Rent (AI)", "Risk Factor (AI)"). Provides access to agent reasoning, confidence scores, and source citations where applicable (e.g., via tooltips or expandable sections).UI-007Feedback MechanismAs a user, I want an easy way to provide feedback on the accuracy or usefulness of agent-generated information.UI elements (e.g., thumbs up/down icons, simple correction forms) adjacent to agent outputs allow users to submit feedback directly, contributing to the Agent Learning System (TI-004).8.
