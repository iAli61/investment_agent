|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **FR-001** | Property Data Input | As a property investor, I want to enter basic property details so that I can analyze its investment potential. | The system should provide input fields for property address, purchase price, property type, year built, size in square meters, number of units, and condition assessment. Data validation ensures numbers are within reasonable ranges. |
| **FR-002** | Purchase Cost Calculator | As an investor, I want to calculate total acquisition costs including closing fees so I understand the full initial investment. | When a user enters the purchase price, the system automatically calculates estimated closing costs (notary, tax, agent fees) based on regional standards. User can override with actual figures. Total acquisition cost updates automatically. |
| **FR-003** | Financing Details | As an investor, I want to input my financing structure so I can understand my loan requirements. | User can enter available cash, desired down payment, and receive calculations for loan amount needed. System should validate that down payment meets minimum requirements (e.g., covers closing costs plus bank's minimum percentage). |
| **FR-004** | Mortgage Payment Calculator | As an investor, I want to calculate my monthly mortgage payments based on various financing terms. | System calculates monthly payments using input loan amount, interest rate, repayment rate (Tilgung), and term. Calculations should show amortization schedule with interest-principal breakdown for each year. |
| **FR-005** | Multi-Unit Rental Structure | As an investor buying a multi-unit building, I want to input details for each unit independently. | System allows adding information for multiple units (occupied/vacant status, size, current rent, potential rent, lease terms). Each unit should be stored separately with its own attributes. |
| **FR-006** | Rental Income Projections | As an investor, I want to estimate potential rental income for vacant units based on local market data. | System should calculate potential rent based on unit size, features, and location using either manual input or integration with rent index data (Mietspiegel). Should flag if estimated rent exceeds legal limits (Mietpreisbremse). |
| **FR-007** | Operating Expenses Calculation | As an investor, I want to estimate all recurring expenses to determine net operating income. | System calculates all regular expenses including property tax, insurance, non-recoverable maintenance costs, property management, and a reserve fund. Expenses should be calculated both as fixed amounts and as percentages of gross income for sensitivity analysis. |
| **FR-008** | Tax Benefit Calculator | As an investor, I want to estimate my tax benefits from property depreciation and expenses. | System calculates depreciation (AfA) based on building value (excluding land value), mortgage interest deductions, and other qualifying expenses. Tax benefit is calculated using user's marginal tax rate to show annual and monthly tax savings. |
